```{r setup, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
plot(x, y, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "Purple")
```

## Componente G

$$G_{m, i, j} = mc^2$$ Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r }
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(mtcars)
library(DT)
datatable(mtcars)
